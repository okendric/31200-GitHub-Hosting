            <p id="aboutParagraph">I'm taking this course for 2 primary reasons. One is that this is one out of two last
                courses I need to take
                to
                achieve the web development certificate. The other reason I'm taking this course is to learn more about
                web
                development! I'm always looking to know more about tips and tricks in the industry. Also, I'd like to
                learn
                what
                programs are commonly used and what to expect within the workfield. I'm excited!</p>
